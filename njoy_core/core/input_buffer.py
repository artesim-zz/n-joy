    It has two consecutive loops :
    - The initial loop collects events until we have a full set of control values.
      When we do, this full state is put in an internal queue, so it can be consumed
      when reading the state property.
      The internal queue remains empty during this phase.

    - The main loop collects events as fast as it can, but only publishes a new state when something changed.

    The state property is a blocking call, which is waiting for a state to be put in the queue
    It then pops and return it, so each state change is only consumed once."""
